# PythonLabUpdateFileThroughAlgorithm

Google Cyber Security Certificate Lab Activity by Kiernan Rodriguez:

Update a file through a Python algorithm

Introduction: 

This lab coding project I completed shows a generic scenario of a healthcare company that needed cybersecurity based assistance for file permissions and security framework updating. The main purpose of this issue was to initiate certain granted permissions for the company’s employees that work with personal patient records that restrict limited access to what they can see or not see. I had to work with prioritizing lots of python methods using the “remove”, “allow”, and many other methods to structure proper coding functions to configure the security framework to set algorithms to check for allowed/restricted lists of an IP address of a company’s database. The main goal was to divide the bad IP addresses that were allowed on the database that needed to be removed from the good ones to stay. I had to properly structure certain methods of code to prevent the potential vulnerabilities that could have evolved into a greater threat to remove the highest amount of risk possible. I managed to succeed and the information down below shows everything i did to accomplish this task.    

Scenario:

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list. Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.
